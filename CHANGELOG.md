# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).


## [1.6.0] - 2026-01-16

### Added
- **8-Color Palette Engine**: Rendering now uses palette slots `1..8` with dimmed variants (`10..83`) for multi-level shading on every pixel.
- **New Palettes**: Added enriched `CARS_ORANGE_V2` and realistic `HUMAN_EYE` 8-color palettes; legacy 3-color schemes are auto-expanded to 8 slots (highlights/shadows) for consistency.

### Changed
- **Animation Recolorization**: All built-in eye animations (IDLE, BLINK, LOOK_*, SLEEP, HAPPY, SAD, ANGRY, SURPRISED) now use the 8-color palette with deeper highlights and shadows; turn signals keep enforced amber for safety.

  - Extended animation names array from 13 to 17 elements in tft_display.cpp.
  - Added display support for: TURN_L (Turn Left signal), TURN_R (Turn Right signal), HAZARD (Hazard lights), and CUSTOM (Custom pattern mode).
  - Now all 17 animation modes display correctly on LCD screen with proper abbreviations.
  - Impact: Users can now see which animation mode is active on the LCD screen for all modes, including vehicle signal animations.

## [1.5.22] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **Notification Box Layout Stability**: Fixed cosmetic issue where notification messages caused page height shifts.
  - Changed notification box from dynamic `display:none/block` to fixed `height:48px` with `opacity` transitions.
  - Notification area now always reserves space in page layout, preventing layout shift when messages appear or disappear.
  - Improved perceived stability of web UI dashboard experience.

  - Frame 0: Eyebrows now angled downward at inner corners with enhanced shading (codes 33-32) for stronger sadness conveyance.
  - Frame 1: Eyebrows completely filled with trembling effect (full row of code 32) simulating active crying; added tear suggestions at lower eye corners (code 23).
  - Iris now tightly squinted (codes 10-31 depth reduction) showing emotional strain.
  - Lower eyelid behavior enhanced: trembling animation creates visual feedback of emotional distress.
  - Result: More nuanced and relatable sad expression that conveys genuine emotional depth despite 8×8 pixel constraints.

## [1.5.20] - 2026-01-15

### Changed
- **Multi-Color Pattern Enhancement**: Enriched all 11 animations with tertiary color shading for greater realism.
  - Added secondary/tertiary tone gradations to iris, pupils, and eyelids.

  - SURPRISED: Three-tone iris with outer highlights for shock effect.
  - Result: More realistic and emotionally expressive 8×8 pixel animations despite resolution constraints.

## [1.5.19] - 2026-01-15

### Changed
- **Project Naming Consistency**: Set official project name to "Cars Eyes" across README and documentation.
- **SLEEP Animation**: Redesigned closed-eye frames with shading and subtle breathing motion for a more natural sleep effect.

## [1.5.18] - 2026-01-15

### Changed
- **Boot Animation - Always IDLE**: Modified boot sequence to always start with IDLE animation regardless of saved state.
  - Changed `init()` function to force `AnimationType::IDLE` at startup.
  - Settings (brightness, colors, scheme) are still loaded from persistent storage.
  - Only animation state is overridden to ensure consistent boot experience.
  - Prevents unexpected animations (like CUSTOM or SLEEP) from persisting across reboots.

### Fixed

  - Migrated pattern storage from web_server.cpp RAM to neopixel.cpp persistent storage.
  - Custom patterns are automatically loaded at startup and saved on every modification.
  - Fixed issue where CUSTOM button did not display patterns created in Pixel Editor.

## [1.5.15] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **Pixel Editor Pattern Loading**: Fixed Pixel Editor to load patterns from server storage instead of unreliable localStorage.
  - Modified `loadPatterns()` to fetch from `/api/custom/get` (server RAM)
  - localStorage now only used as fallback and for temporary UI state during editing
  - Editor now displays previously saved patterns when opened
  - Ensures consistency between Dashboard CUSTOM button and Pixel Editor
  - Both now use server-side storage as single source of truth

## [1.5.14] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **CUSTOM Pattern Storage - Root Cause Fix**: Identified and resolved fundamental issue with localStorage persistence on ESP32.
  - **Root Cause**: Browser localStorage is NOT persistent across page reloads on embedded devices; data is lost on navigation.
  - **Solution**: Moved pattern storage from client-side localStorage to server-side RAM (global arrays).
  - **New API**: Added `/api/custom/get` endpoint to retrieve saved patterns from server.
  - **Updated Flow**:
    1. Pixel Editor saves patterns → `/api/custom/apply` → stored in server RAM (g_customPatternLeft/Right)
    2. Dashboard CUSTOM button → loads from `/api/custom/get` → applies via `/api/custom/apply`
    3. Patterns now persist throughout session (until device restart)

## [1.5.13] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed

  - Simplified validation: now accepts patterns with at least one pixel drawn instead of requiring both eyes.
  - Added comprehensive console logging for debugging pattern application flow.
  - Implemented URL encoding for safe transmission of pattern data.
  - Enhanced error handling with detailed user feedback via alerts and messages.
  - Verified API endpoint compatibility with both formats (hex and decimal support via strtol base-0).

## [1.5.12] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **LCD Display Layout**: Fixed red separator line and MODE information positioning on LCD screen.
  - Red separator line now correctly positioned after mDNS information instead of overlapping.

- **Web UI**: Added CUSTOM button to animation controls and "Pixel Editor" link on dashboard.

## [1.5.9] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **Hazard Mode Behavior**: Fixed hazard/warning button to remain active as a normal animation instead of timing out.
  - **TURN_LEFT** (13): Responds to configured duration timeout.
  - **TURN_RIGHT** (14): Responds to configured duration timeout.
  - **HAZARD** (15): Now stays active indefinitely until another animation is selected (like standard animations).
- **Web UI Signal Logic**: Differentiated signal behavior - only turn signals use timeout, hazard mode behaves like persistent animations.

## [1.5.8] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed

## [1.5.4] - 2026-01-15

### Changed
- **Turn Signal Design**: Updated arrow patterns to use the full width of the matrix (8 pixels), simulating a more realistic automotive arrow style.

## [1.5.3] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **Rendering**: Fixed rendering engine to correctly interpret the specialized pixel code (100) used for Turn Signal patterns, which was previously resulting in blank output.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **Button Logic**: Completely rewrote button handling logic to fix unresponsiveness on Button 1 and improve press detection.
- **Turn Signal Visuals**: The "non-signaling" eye now remains open (Idle pattern) instead of turning off while the other signal is active.
- **Hazard Mode**: Corrected detection for simultaneous button presses (Warning mode).

## [1.5.1] - 2026-01-15

- **LOOK_UP Animation**: Corrected `LOOK_UP` pattern to exactly mirror `LOOK_DOWN` logic (iris moving up) for consistency.
- **Latency**: Removed frame delay on effect switch for instant response.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **LCD Display**: Fixed black screen issue on ESP32-S3 by switching backlight control from PWM to digital HIGH.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-01-15

### Added
- **Rendering Engine**: Complete rewrite of `neopixel.cpp` to support anti-aliasing (partial brightness).
- **Color Schemes**: Added "Cars" (Lightning McQueen), "Realistic", and "Elegant" visual themes.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-14

### Change 5 - Enhancement: More expressive BLINK pattern
**File:** `src/neopixel.cpp` (lines 47-56)  
**Problem:** The original BLINK pattern used a simple flat horizontal line (rows 3-4 only), which was not expressive enough to simulate a natural eye blink.  
**Solution:** Complete pattern redesign to create a rounded closed-eye shape spanning 6 active rows (rows 1-6). The pattern now shows upper and lower eyelids converging toward a central closure point.  
**Impact:** Much more natural and expressive blink animation, enhancing the personality of the animated eyes.

### Change 4 - Fix: xyToIndex() function for linear LED numbering
**File:** `src/neopixel.cpp` (lines 155-164)  
**Problem:** The xyToIndex() function implemented zigzag compensation (mirroring odd rows), but user revealed that LED matrices are wired linearly (0-63 in reading order).  
**Solution:** Complete simplification of xyToIndex() to return `y * NEOPIXEL_MATRIX_WIDTH + x`, removing all zigzag logic.  
**Impact:** All patterns now display correctly without even/odd row misalignment.

### Change 3 - Fix: LOOK_LEFT and LOOK_RIGHT patterns
**File:** `src/neopixel.cpp` (lines 60-81)  
**Problem:** LOOK_LEFT and LOOK_RIGHT patterns didn't follow linear LED numbering and didn't move the entire eye like LOOK_UP/LOOK_DOWN did.  
**Solution:** Complete redesign of both patterns to move a full rounded eye (like LOOK_UP/DOWN). LOOK_LEFT positions eye at columns 1-4, LOOK_RIGHT at columns 3-6. Patterns designed for linear numbering.  
**Impact:** Eyes now move correctly left and right with smooth, symmetric motion.

### Change 2 - Enhancement: Web UI text contrast
**File:** `src/web_ui.cpp` (CSS styles, lines ~20-55)  
**Problem:** System information texts (Brightness: 32, Auto-Play Mode, ESP32-S3, 240 MHz, etc.) were not readable due to insufficient contrast (default gray text on white background).  
**Solution:** CSS enhancement with darker colors (#222 for .card div, #333 for labels) and added font-weight (500-600) for key elements (.card strong, .color-group label, .slider-label, button).  
**Impact:** All web interface texts are now clearly readable.

### Change 1 - Fix: Obsolete setColor() function
**File:** `src/buttons.cpp` (line 41)  
**Problem:** Code was calling `NeoPixel::setColor()` which no longer exists in the refactored NeoPixel module API.  
**Solution:** Replaced with `NeoPixel::setStatusLed(NeoPixel::makeColor(0, 0, 255))` to set status LED to blue before restart.  
**Impact:** Fixed compilation error, system now compiles successfully.
